## Setting Up a Jupyter Notebook Client
If you use docker, the jupyter client will be automatically initiated and the key will be extracted and injected in config. However, if you want to do it manually, follow the below steps:

To set up a Jupyter Notebook client in the same directory as the Solidus Backend project, follow these steps:

1. **Install Jupyter Notebook**:
    If you haven't already, you need to install Jupyter Notebook. You can do this using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install notebook
    ```

2. **Start Jupyter Notebook**:
    Navigate to the project directory and start the Jupyter Notebook server:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```

3. **Access Jupyter Notebook**:
    After running the above command, your default web browser will open and you will be able to access the Jupyter Notebook interface. Copy the token to config and set in `PYTHON_TOKEN` key.
